Created during the 14-day Acerola Jam 0, Lightweaver challenges players to bend, split, and redirect light beams using mirrors, prisms, and black holes to solve increasingly complex puzzles. The game features chromatic aberration effects where white light splits into RGB components, requiring players to hit specific colored targets in the correct sequence across multiple themed environments.

While this appears to be a simple light-physics puzzle game on the surface, it has hidden complexity in Unity's Line Renderer system optimization and real-time light beam calculations. I used this project to challenge myself in game jam development and explore advanced rendering techniques while creating polished gameplay mechanics under tight time constraints.
